- Rewrite MQSERIES_SETOPT_/MQSERIES_ADD_ASSOC macros and use them everywhere
	- Use do {} while(0);
	- Remove deps on external variables

- In the code we use a lot of MQLONG and transform them to Zval, see if we can improve memory footprint by directly giving the long
	pointer of the zval as MQLONG to avoid :
	ZVAL_LONG(z_comp_code, comp_code);

- Add MQSERIES_MQCNO_HANDLE_SHARE_BLOCK in the constant list

- Make the MQSUB hObj in/out
